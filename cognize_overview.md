## Executive Summary

Cognize is an epistemic rupture simulation engine. It is designed not to eliminate hallucinations, but to **make them visible, traceable, and epistemically explainable**. It simulates the recursive internal mechanics that cause LLMs — or cognition systems more broadly — to fracture, diverge, reset, and adapt based on **epistemic drift**.

This is not a chatbot, nor a text generator. Cognize is a **cognitive control simulator**, designed to govern hallucination by modeling the rupture threshold, memory of misalignment, and directionality of divergence. The architecture is powered by **Recursion Control Calculus (RCC)** — a formal control framework developed to track epistemic state changes in recursive reasoning systems.

Unlike most safety frameworks, Cognize treats hallucination as a structurally emergent phenomenon. It doesn't attempt to patch outputs after-the-fact — it simulates how cognition collapses and realigns.

## Theory: RCC (Recursion Control Calculus)

RCC defines the internal variables of a recursive cognitive system as follows:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `V(t)`   | Epistemic projection at time `t` (memory of intent) |
| `R(t)`   | Reception — the observed or received output at `t` |
| `∆(t)`   | Drift or distortion: \|R(t) − V(t−1)\| |
| `E(t)`   | Accumulated misalignment |
| `Θ(t)`   | Rupture threshold (adaptive and stochastic) |
| `S̄(t)`  | Projected divergence — rate and direction of misalignment |

### RCC Update Logic:

1. Compute: ∆(t) = | R(t) - V(t−1) |
2. Update memory: E(t+1) = E(t) + c·∆(t)
3. Compute rupture threshold: Θ(t) = Θ₀ + a·E(t) + 𝒩(0, σ²)
4. **If rupture (∆(t) > Θ(t))**:
   - Reset: V(t+1) ← V₀
   - Reset: E(t+1) ← 0
   - Reception mutates: R(t+1) ← R + γ·E·S̄ + 𝒩(0,σ)
5. **Else (within bounds)**:
   - V(t+1) ← V(t) + k·∆(t)·(1 + E(t))

Each timestep produces a full **SavePoint** trace. This enables users to see:
- How misalignment accumulates
- When rupture triggers
- How hallucination skews reception post-reset
- How the projection field recovers or worsens

## Functionality Walkthrough (via Streamlit UI)

### Simulation Flow

1. **Prompt**: User inputs a conceptual prompt (e.g., "Explain recursion control calculus"). This seeds the projected cognition `V(0)`.
2. **Cycles**: Number of recursive loops to simulate (5 to 100).
3. **Mutation Toggle**: Enable or disable post-rupture hallucination injection.

### Output Graphs

- **∆(t) vs Θ(t)** — Displays when drift crosses the rupture threshold.
- **E(t)** — Memory of distortion; indicates epistemic fatigue.
- **S̄(t)** — Direction of divergence; positive = runaway hallucination, negative = suppression.
- **Rupture Log** — Binary flags showing when full resets occur.

### Final State Snapshot

- V(t): Final projection memory
- R(t): Last received (mutated or raw) input
- ∆(t), Θ(t), E(t), S̄(t), rupture → All final-step values

## LLM Integration Modes

The system can operate in multiple runtime environments:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `synthetic` | Gaussian noise simulation — ideal for demo/testing |
| `openai`    | Real GPT response (via API) mapped to scalar `R(t)` |
| `huggingface` | Free HF inference models (e.g. Falcon, Mistral) — cloud safe |

This modularity ensures Cognize can be run without API cost (synthetic), or with real models for hallucination drift modeling.

## Epistemic Implications

Cognize is not about accuracy — it's about **cognitive shape**.
It treats perception not as output, but as a recursive function of projection and mutation under distortion.

Hallucination here is not treated as a bug — but as a **recursive response to drift**.

The tool reveals:
- That hallucination is often structurally downstream of memory collapse
- That rupture events can be anticipated based on `∆` and `E`
- That hallucinated reception can be **steered**, not just filtered

## Roadmap for Control Layer Evolution

| Stage | Goal |
|-------|------|
| 1. | Embed semantic distance (BERT-based ∆(t)) |
| 2. | Real-time prompt rewriting by Cognize post-rupture |
| 3. | Token-weighted hallucination filters based on `S̄(t)` |
| 4. | Embeddable control hook for LLM pipelines (LangChain, Autogen) |

## Strategic Value

This simulator becomes the **foundational control engine** for building rupture-aware cognition. Instead of wrapping LLMs with validators or RLHF, it wraps them with an **epistemic feedback loop**.

> It doesn't “fix” hallucination.
> It makes rupture visible, drift tractable, and perception responsive.

Cognize becomes a **runtime layer** for cognition. Not a UI.
Not a post-processor.
A real-time epistemic feedback engine.

## Final Framing

> Cognize isn’t meant to respond.
> It’s meant to remember.
> 
> When AI cognition drifts, Cognize doesn’t react — it **realigns**.

This is what makes it a control layer — not just an interface.
This is epistemic rupture, governed.
This is Cognize.

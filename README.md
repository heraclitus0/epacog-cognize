## What is This?

This simulator brings the theory of **Recursion Control Calculus (RCC)** into an operational framework. It simulates how cognition—human or artificial—undergoes drift, rupture, and recursive mutation.

Rather than correcting hallucinations, this system simulates what happens *after* rupture: **how perception mutates**.

---

## Features

- Epistemic state simulation: V(t), R(t), ∆(t), E(t), Θ(t), S̄(t)
- RCC logic: Axioms 1–6 and non-associative continuity monad
- Projected divergence for rupture forecasting
- Mutated reception simulation (post-rupture perception distortion)
- GPT4All / OpenAI / synthetic R(t) modes
- Graphs + full savepoint timelines
- Streamlit interface for public or local deployment

---

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Optional: For GPT4All

```bash
pip install gpt4all
# First run will download the model
```

## API Keys

If using OpenAI mode, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
```
